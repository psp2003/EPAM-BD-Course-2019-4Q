Task: Controlling access to files with Linux file system permissions
Create directory /home/students, where all 3 users can work with files.
	mkdir /home/students
 	chown -R :students /home/students
There should be only user and group access, with permissions to create and delete files.
	chmod 2770 /home/students # 2 -> Sticky bit, 660 only for files
Group students should be owner of all future files.

Anyone should be able to read/write and execute files in this directory.
But only the user created a file, can then delete it.
	Answer: login 'root' user
		mkdir /data1/
