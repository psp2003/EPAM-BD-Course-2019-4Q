cron/anacron
1. Create an anacron job which executes a script with echo Hello > /opt/hello and runs every 2 days
	Create script file ~/anacronHW.sh:
		#!/bin/bash
		echo Hello > /opt/hello
	Edit /etc/anacron (add string)
	2 0 anacronHW /bin/bash /home/vit/anacronHW.sh
2. Create a cron job which executes the same command (will be better to create a script for this) and runs it in 1 minute after system boot.
		@reboot root sleep 60 && /home/vit/anacronHW/hello.sh
3. Restart your virtual machine and check previous job proper execution
	cat /opt/hello
	[vit@vm01 ~]$ cat /opt/hello
		Hello
